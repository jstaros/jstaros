## 🧛‍♀️ About Ghouls in V5

According to the *V5 Player’s Guide* and *V5 Core Rules*:
- Ghouls are mortals who have ingested vampiric vitae.
- They gain one Level-1 power in a Discipline known by their domitor.
- They never make Rouse Checks but suffer **1 Aggravated damage** when using higher-level powers.
- They retain Humanity (typically 7) and operate under mortal limits, with minor supernatural boosts.

This builder follows those parameters and incorporates ghoul-specific options from the Player’s Guide for reference.
